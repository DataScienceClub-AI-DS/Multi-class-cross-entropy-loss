# Multi-class-cross-entropy-loss

Multi-class cross entropy loss is used in multi-class classification, such as the MNIST digits classification problem, Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks. Like above we use the cross entropy function which after a few calculations we obtain the multi-class cross-entropy loss L for each training example being:
